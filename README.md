# Typegoose

Do you use [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)? Do you use [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)? Then maybe you should try [Typegoose](https://github.com/szokodiakos/typegoose)!
This Node project should get you quickly up and running with Typegoose. It includes the timestamps option, and a basic schema plugin.

## Prerequisite
* A running instance of MongoDB (but if you're already using Mongoose then you knew that.) I used v3.6.2 for this project.
* yarn package manager (optional)

## Run the things!
1. If using yarn, `yarn install`; otherwise, `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm start`
4. Your MongoDB test db should now have a new document

## Disclaimer
I don't represent Typescript, MongoDB, Mongoose, or Typegoose. Please refer to the linked projects at the top of this Readme if you need help with those.
